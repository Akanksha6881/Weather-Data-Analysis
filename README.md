# Weather-Data-Analysis
Weather Data Analysis using Python

This project focuses on analyzing a Kaggle-provided weather dataset (8,784 records) using NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib on Google Colab. The goal was to explore, clean, and visualize the data to identify meaningful patterns and insights about weather conditions.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:

Processed and analyzed 8,700+ hourly weather observations.

Performed data cleaning, statistical analysis, and trend exploration using Pandas & NumPy.

Visualized patterns through line plots, histograms, and monthly average graphs.

Extracted insights such as:

Most frequent weather conditions (Fog, Snow, Rain, etc.)

Seasonal changes in temperature, humidity, and pressure

Correlation between weather parameters

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack:

Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)

Google Colab

Dataset Source: Kaggle Weather Dataset

ðŸ”¹ Outcomes:

Built a structured Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project.

Gained insights into real-world weather data trends.

Enhanced skills in data visualization, trend analysis, and data preprocessing.
